## No PII Collected

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable informtion ("**PII**") about you.  However, you may provide PII voluntarily in the content you provide.  For example, you may include your name and address in your content.  Our service passes your information (along with any PII you voluntarily include) to a third party provider described below.  Even where PII is included in your content, TheCharmCheck does not collect the information, it only passes it to our third party provider.

### Disclosure to Third Party Providers

While TheCharmCheck itself does not collect any PII, it acts as a middleman to pass PII you voluntarily include in your content to three different providers ("**AI Model Providers**").  We encourage you to omit any PII you don't want to share in the content you submit.  To provide our reporting and chatbot features, we use AI models from the following AI Model Providers:

* OpenAI, L.L.C.
  * Privacy Policy: <https://openai.com/privacy/>
    * TheCharmCheck has "opted-out" of OpenAI's use of our data for improving their services, meaning your content will NOT be used by OpenAI to train or improve their models.  TheCharmCheck uses OpenAI's GPT-4-Vision model.  According to the documentation, "after an image has been processed by the model, it is deleted from OpenAI servers and not retained".  This statement can be found at <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision>.
* Anthropic, PBC
  * Terms of Service: <https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms>
    * Anthropic will not be using your data to train their future models.  According to the documentation, all data (include images) will be deleted within 28 days unless it is necessary to enforce their Acceptable Use Policy or to comply with the law.  <https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/7996866-how-long-do-you-store-personal-data>
* Google, LLC
  * Privacy Policy: <https://ai.google.dev/terms>
    * We will not be using Google models until the preview term is over, at which point, your data will not be used to improve their services. All data (including images) are only stored transiently or cached and not kept.

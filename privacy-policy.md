## No PII Collected

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable informtion ("**PII**") about you.  However, you may provide PII voluntarily in the content you provide.  For example, you may include your name and address in your content.  Our service passes your information (along with any PII you voluntarily include) to a third party provider described below.  Even where PII is included in your content, TheCharmCheck does not collect the information, it only passes it to our third party provider.

### Disclosure to Third Party Provider - OpenAI

We use OpenAI, L.L.C.'s ("**OpenAI**") Chat Completion API to provide our reporting and chatbot features.  While TheCharmCheck itself does not collect any PII, it acts as a middleman to pass PII you voluntarily include in your content to OpenAI.  We encourage you to omit any PII you don't want to share in the content you submit.  We also encourage you to review OpenAI's privacy policy at <https://openai.com/privacy/>.  TheCharmCheck has "opted-out" of OpenAI's use of our data for improving their services, meaning your content will NOT be used by OpenAI to train or improve their models.  TheCharmCheck uses OpenAI's GPT-4-Vision model.  According to the documentation, "after an image has been processed by the model, it is deleted from OpenAI servers and not retained".  This statement can be found at <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision>.
